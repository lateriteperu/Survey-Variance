# Simple Random Sampling (SRS)

In **Simple Random Sampling (SRS)**, every unit in the population has the same probability of being selected.  
Variance estimation is straightforward, using the standard formula for the variance of the sample mean.

## Formula
For a sample of size `n`:

    Var(ȳ) = s² / n

where `s²` is the sample variance.
